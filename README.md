### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

-Yeah, the lectures were concise and on point. Live coding sessions was a huge help to quickly pick up the concepts. Specially the discussion on useState and Form was really helpful. Weekly assignments were very closely related to the projects but I guess, I need more practice with designing first and coding later. The designing part kinda felt intimidating.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
-If I had more time, the I would arrange my components more efficiently. An additional feature I would add would be sidebar and also a slideshow banner.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

-Didn't do demo this week.
